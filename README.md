# WORK IN PROGRESS

This repository aims to be a simple comparison of some C++ REST frameworks.
This project was inspired by the article [C++ REST API frameworks benchmark](https://blog.binaryspaceship.com/2017/cpp-rest-api-frameworks-benchmark/) from [Binary Spaceship](https://github.com/binaryspaceship) but I'm adding more frameworks to the tests and also
using docker instead of vagrant

# Building and Running

You must have **Docker** and **Docker Compose** up and running in your system. After
that, by simply issuing the following commands:

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

should bring all services running from port 18001 to 18005
